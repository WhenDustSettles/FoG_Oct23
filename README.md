# FoG_Jan24
Facets of Geometry, as of January, 2024.
Recent additions:
  1. Some results on simplicial sets and $\pi_1$.
  2. More on homology theories and Mayer-Vietoris.
  3. Added a generalization of normalization which I call _strongly local construction on rings_, in which I prove a theorem about their gluability, which in a particular case yields normalization of an integral scheme.
